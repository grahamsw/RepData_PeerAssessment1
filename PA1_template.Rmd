## Loading and preprocessing the data

I read the csv without saving the unzipped file.
```{r echo=TRUE}
df <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"))


df$dt <- ymd(df$date)

head(df)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo=TRUE}
ms <- tapply(df$steps, df$dt, sum, na.rm=TRUE)

```
histogram (not a graph of steps against days, but of num days per (binned) num steps)

``` {r echo=TRUE}
qplot(ms, xlab='steps per day', ylab='frequency', binwidth=1000)
```

mean steps per day = ```r mean(ms) ```
median steps per day = ```r median(ms) ```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
